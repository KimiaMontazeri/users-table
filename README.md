# Table of Users

This repo is a simple React application that renders a table showing a list of users with the below columns:
- User ID
- Name
- Date of Registration
- Address
- Phone Number

The table has **pagination**, **sorting**, and **filtering** functionalities. It can be sorted by the date in ascending or descending order. 
You can filter the shown data by the name, address, or phone number.

**The current page and all the filtering and sorting are stored in the URL search parameters.**
